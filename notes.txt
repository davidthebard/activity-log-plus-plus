  - M3: implement full pld.dat backup/restore functionality
  - M4: TCP host/client handshake over local Wi-Fi (SOC service + soc:U)
  - M5: improve pld.dat backup/restore functionality to support multiple backups with timestamps
  - M6: Merge algorithm (same title+hour → sum play_secs, cap at 3600)
  - M7: Summary exchange + merge in memory (viewer shows correct merged app count and stats — no
  NAND write yet)
  - M8: Write both the merged session log and summary to NAND with backup of original

  M9 — SD card as the merged-data store
  Replace the NAND write flow entirely. On first launch, read from NAND as now. After a successful
   sync, write the merged result to sdmc:/3ds/3ds-activity-sync/merged.dat (same pld.dat format,
  so all existing code reuses). On subsequent launches, load from merged.dat if it exists rather
  than re-reading NAND. Remove the M8 NAND write block. Timestamped backups stay and now back up
  the SD merged file.

  M10 — Embedded title database
  A static sorted array of (title_id, name) pairs compiled into the binary. Source data from a
  community title database (there are GitHub repos maintaining exactly this — title_id to name
  mappings for all retail and eShop titles). A build-time script converts it to a C source file.
  title_db_lookup(u64 title_id) does a binary search and returns the name string or NULL for
  unknowns. A few hundred KB in the ROM, negligible at runtime.

  M11 — Graphics UI: game list
  Switch from printf console mode to citro2d rendering. Top screen becomes a scrollable game list
  — name (from title DB), total playtime, launch count. Bottom screen shows aggregate stats (total
   games tracked, combined playtime, number of syncs). Clean visual style inspired by the native
  Activity Log's layout and colour scheme.

  M12 — AM name query + SD persistence + sync exchange
  Use the 3DS AM service to enumerate all installed titles (NAND, SD, and inserted cartridge),
  read icon.bin (SMDH) from each title's content archive via FSUSER_OpenFileDirectly, extract
  the UTF-16 short description, and convert to UTF-8. Persist results to
  sdmc:/3ds/3ds-activity-sync/title_names.dat. During sync, exchange title name databases so
  each device learns the names of the other's games. AM-scanned names take priority over the
  embedded static database; the static DB remains as a fallback for uninstalled titles.

  M13 — Per-title detail view
  Selecting a game from the list opens a detail screen: full name, total time, launch count,
  first/last played dates, and a scrollable session log showing each hour-slot with its date and
  duration. B returns to the list.
